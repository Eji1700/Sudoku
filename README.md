# Sudoku
Mostly immutable and tried to be idiomatic, although i did focus on staying immutable for practice.  UI has some mutable code due to how you interact with the Console. 

Currently has 0 for loops. One of the early questin I had when learning F# was "how the hell do i do anything without just defaulting to for loops", and a lot of the example I found just fell back on them, so a major goal to try and not use them at all for this as an exmaple of how data can be manipulated without using them at all.

Technically cross platform(i think?  I've not tested) and working on giving it two front ends. Currently has a console output but am looking at using fabulous for the rest
