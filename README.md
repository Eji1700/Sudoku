# Sudoku
Mostly immutable and tried to be idiomatic, although i did focus on staying immutable for practice (for example not mutating array values which isn't something you'd normally do).  UI has some mutable code due to how you interact with the Console. 

Currently has 0 for loops. One of the early questions I had when learning F# was "how the hell do i do anything without just defaulting to for loops", and a lot of the examples I found were using them as well, so a major goal was to not use any to make an example for those like me.

Technically cross platform(i think?  I've not tested) and working on giving it two front ends. Currently has a console output(ok not anymore, i'm refactoring again) but am looking at using fabulous for the "proper" front end.
